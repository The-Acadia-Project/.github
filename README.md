# This is the official page for The Acadia Project, a FiveM server development project dedicated to mixing the culture, style and vibe of the City of Chicago with those of Rockstar Games' Grand Theft Auto V. The project takes inspiration from the City of Chicago itself as well as the fictional variant created by Ubisoft Montr√©al as seen in Watch_Dogs.
